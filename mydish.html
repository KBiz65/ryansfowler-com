          Having parsed through the reseach of the previous teams, I had a good
          idea of what the users wanted, but didn’t see much in the way of why
          it was designed how it was. I took a critical eye to the designs and

          of each modification and version of them.

          because it <a class="bold">sucks typing recipes</a>, and there is no

          Testing revealed that most home cooks would not know to simply click
